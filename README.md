# Seasonal-Thermocline-in-the-Global-Argentine-Basin

The goal for this project was to visualize how the thermocline in a location changes as time passes.  More specifically, how the seasonal temperature profile differs as depth increases.  CTD data was collected from a number of depths in the Global Argentine Basin array of sensors on the Ocean Observatories Initiative website.

All data was downloaded from 6 CTD sensors from the OOI website.  Links to each of the sensors are shown below.
